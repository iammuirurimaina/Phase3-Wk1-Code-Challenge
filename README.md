# Phase3-Wk1-Code-Challenge
This repository contains solutions to three programming challenges that test  problem-solving and coding skills. Each challenge focuses on a different aspect of programming, from time conversion to number analysis. Read on to learn more about each challenge and how to tackle it.

**Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time**

Problem Statement
Converting a 12-hour time representation to a 24-hour time format is the goal of this challenge. Given an hour (ranging from 1 to 12), a minute (ranging from 0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm"), your task is to create a function that returns a four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.

Functionalities
Define a function that accepts the hour, minute, and period as input.
Implement the conversion logic to transform the input time into 24-hour format.
Account for conventions like noon being represented as 12:00 pm and midnight as 12:00 am.


**Challenge 2: Identifying Two Positive Numbers**
Problem Statement
In this challenge, your objective is to design a function that takes three integers as arguments and determines whether exactly two out of the three numbers are positive integers (greater than zero).

Functionalities
Create a function that accepts three integer inputs.
Implement logic to check if exactly two out of the three integers are positive.
Return True if the condition is met; otherwise, return False.


**Challenge 3: Calculating Consonant Substring Values**
Problem Statement
This challenge involves processing a lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters. Your task is to find the highest value among the consonant substrings in the string. Consonants are defined as any letters except "aeiou," and they are assigned values from a=1 to z=26.

Functionalities
Create a function that takes a lowercase string as input.
Implement a mechanism to identify consonant substrings within the input string.
Calculate the value of each consonant substring according to the provided value assignments.
Return the highest calculated value among all consonant substrings.

**Getting Started**
To begin, you can clone this repository and access the solutions to each challenge in their respective folders. Each challenge folder contains a solution file and a readme with detailed explanations and code breakdowns. The solution files are named as follows:

challenge-1.py for Challenge 1
challenge-2.py for Challenge 2
challenge-3.py for Challenge 3
Feel free to explore the solutions, understand the implementation, and modify the code to enhance your understanding.
